# Contributing to The Liturgists App

Thanks for being a part of this! Here are a few things you should know before getting started.

## Code of Conduct

This project is guided by a [Contributor Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating in the project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Pull Requests

Every contribution should be done via pull request, so that your peers on the team have a chance
to review the code for style, cleanliness, efficiency, and other points of general cromulence.
This is a great way for us to all learn from each others' experience, so please take the time
to go through the process; it will benefit the project and the team greatly.

## Style guides

### Git commit messages

From [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line.
1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
1. Capitalize the subject line.
1. Do not end the subject line with a period.
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
1. Wrap the body at 72 characters.
1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.

Other notes:
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit description

### JavaScript code style

This project adheres to the Airbnb style guides for [JavaScript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/)
and [React/JSX](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react). The one major deviation known
at this time is that React component files shall be named with a `.js` suffix, NOT `.jsx` (see #4 for why).
